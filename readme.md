# One-armed bandit

The one-armed bandit is a simple game which can be run in your web browser. Your initial money is $200. You cannot bid more money than you have got in your wallet. You can win in two cases:
- all shapes are different (color has no meaning),
- all shapes have the same color (shapes can be different).

If you are lucky, your win is equal to bid multiplied by three.
